4. Runs the sampler for each bacth
5. Extracts the results and save them as pkl files

Parameters:

- batch_size: The number of polygons to process per batch.
- polygon_collection: The feature collection of polygons from 
  the specified site.
- total_polygons: The total number of polygons in the feature
  collection.
